# ETS2 - Rich Presence on Discord
An easy tool to let others see your current job, speed, truck etc. using Discord Rich Presence!  

Here's our Discord server for support and getting your image featured: https://discord.gg/UwSJjSA  

In different weather or time, your image will change on the rich presence.
